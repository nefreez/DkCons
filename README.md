DkCons
======
first commit 19.05.2014
search web search mechanism like nefreez/first.
Differences:
nefreez/first: all calculations are done while streaming from www, no data stored; nefreez/DkCons: www content is downloaded, stored and then processed.
nefreez/first: most part of mechanism described inside main method; nefreez/DkCons: all processes are divided to other methods, main method only calls commands.
